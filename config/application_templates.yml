# Application PDF Template Versions
#
# IMPORTANT: Never modify an existing template version.
# To make changes, create a new version and add it here.
#
# Each version contains:
#   - file: path to the template file (relative to Rails.root)
#   - hash: SHA-256 hash of the template file for integrity verification
#   - created_at: date the template was created
#   - render_engine: the gem/version used to fill this template
#
# The hash ensures we can prove which exact document was signed
# (required for DOT/FMCSA compliance per 49 CFR Parts 391 and 40)
